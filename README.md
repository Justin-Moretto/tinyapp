# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (similar to bit.ly or tinyURL).
Users must sign in to view, edit, create, and delete their shortened urls. 
Uses bcrypt to hash passwords and cookie-session to handle login status.
